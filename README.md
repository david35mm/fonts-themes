# David Andrés' preferred fonts, icons, and themes

## 📁 The Repository

This repository contains the fonts, icons, and themes I use on my GNU/Linux system. Everything is packed into a `.tar.xz` archive to keep the repository lightweight and make downloads faster.

## 🚀 How to install

I have an automated script that clones my main [.files repo](https://github.com/david35mm/.files) and applies a few additional system tweaks. At the moment, it works on Fedora and **vanilla** Arch Linux. Some of the changes include improved DNF/Pacman configuration and aliases, automatic installation of a few window managers, and the software selection I use, among other things.

To install the fonts, themes, and icons:

1. Run the script below
2. Select option `4`
3. Choose `Install window managers and some utilities`
4. Type `5` to install everything automatically

Here is the script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david35mm/up35mm/main/up35mm.sh | sh
```

## 👋 Who is David Andrés?

I started out studying Electronic Engineering, but I am now doing Computer Science. I am especially interested in free and open-source software. I was born in [Bogotá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1), the capital city of [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia). Since starting my undergraduate degree at the [National University of Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Colombia), I have been living in [Manizales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manizales).

Photography has been one of my main hobbies over the past few years, and I also run a [small YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8MDD0AHj0-ZUPolunq6MQ) where I share tips and explain photography concepts. All the videos are in Spanish.

The “35mm” in my nickname comes from the classic photographic film format. I also have [my own portfolio](https://david35mm.com/tags/carrete/) — I mainly focus on portrait photography.

As for GNU/Linux, I have been using Fedora (stable branch) for the past few years, although I am still tempted to give Rawhide a go. Throughout most of 2021, I used Artix Linux (with s6 init). Feel free to DM me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/david35mm.co) if you would like to chat (or practise your Spanish).
